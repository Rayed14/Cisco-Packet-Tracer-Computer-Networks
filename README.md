# Computer-Networking
In this project I made a network topology and connected different routers with different routing algorithms and redistributed them to send data to each other. Furthermore the devies connected to the routers recieved Ips via the DHCP server.

This was a networking project made on cisco packet tracer. We were to connect a topology of differnet devices and different routers together. The routers had different routing algorithms applied like RIP, EIGRP, OSPF area 1 and OSPF area 0. I also added two DHCP servers that were used to give the IP address to the devices connected. 
This project also incorporates Blocking from one network to another, as well as one device to a server. 
Furthermore, NATTING is applied to give one of the networks a private IP address.

Thank You
